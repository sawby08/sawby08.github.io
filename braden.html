                    <p>Heya, I'm Braden! I'm a 16-year-old who likes to animate stuff, as well as program games and make my own music.<br><br>I use Adobe Animate 2024 to animate, Krita for illustration, FL Studio 2024 to make music, and Godot/LÃ–VE for game development. <br><br> I've been animating since 2018 and switched to Adobe Animate in 2022. I value quality in my work and having versatility in my skills and I hope I can put those to good use in the future!</p>
