<p>silly repo for my silly website. mainly for my animation portfolio but it's also just my do-anything-site if i desire to do anything more with it at some point!</p>

<p>as of right now the site isn't finished. some pages don't have any content in them and i still need to fix some bugs ðŸ¥¹</p>

<p>additionally i MUST preface that i am not a web developer. if you see any gross coding methods on my part then just blame w3schools and stack overflow i code video games not websites</p>
