        <p>thanks to my friend trinity (planetdaikatana.net) for helping me go through the process of buying the site and setting it up. goated for that</p>
        <p>this website was JUST made (oct 21, 2025), so it's incredibly unfinished. hopefully in the upcoming weeks it will have a significantly cooler layout</p>
